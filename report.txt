Membership Inference Attack Report
----------------------------------
- Dataset: Texas-100 (first 200 records considered)
- Model: 4-layer dense neural network (Loaded as TensorFlow SavedModel)
- Attack Method: Confidence Score + Entropy Ranking
- Selected Top 100 Most Likely Members
- Output File: members.txt

Methodology:
We used a ranking approach where we computed the confidence score (maximum softmax probability)
and subtracted the entropy of the softmax distribution. Higher confidence and lower entropy indicate
that a sample is more likely to have been in the training set.

Results:
The IDs of the inferred training samples are saved in 'members.txt'.
